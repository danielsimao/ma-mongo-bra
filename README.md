React hooks is the latest react release. It allows to some extend replace redux, using available functions, such as createContenxt() and useReducer(). This is game changing, since a hard boilerplate provided by redux can be replace for an approach that takes 5 minutes to setup.

!UPDATE!

Version 1.0.0 contains a working replacement of redux with react hooks. Version 2.0.0 will have redux instead of useReducer and createContext (sad)
